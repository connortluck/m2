Midterm II project, Ising Model

This program is meant to estimate the temperature of the phase transition of a ferromagnetic 
ising model on a triangular lattice structure. The program will take into account the interactions 
with neighbors in the latice and it is important to note that this model is for 2D interactions. 

Basic program was derived in class however, notable changes include the shift of conisidering 6 neighbors 
instead of the 4 that would be considered in a square configuration, as well as the increase of 16 energy states 
to 24.
